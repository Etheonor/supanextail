## A MDX Blog

This is a small example of a blog post.
Can you make it bigger?
I'm sure you can!

In this article, you can see a small button at the bottom. It's a React component!
This is possible thanks to the support of the .mdx format. Want to know more?
You can go [on this site](https://mdxjs.com/).

## Tailwind Typography

The blog posts are formatted with the Tailwind Typography plugin.
Here is the description from the official documentation:

_The official Tailwind CSS Typography plugin provides a set of prose classes you can use to add beautiful typographic defaults to any vanilla HTML you donâ€™t control, like HTML rendered from Markdown, or pulled from a CMS._

If you want to customize the typography,
you can change the classes in the post-body.tsx file.
To know more about Tailwind Typography,
you can [check the documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin).

## And this is a MDX example

This button is a React component inside a MDX file. Crazy, right?

<Button>Click me</Button>
